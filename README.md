# Coffee Data Analytics Project

### Project Description
In this project, I am using a dataset about coffee that includes customer profiles, orders, and a range of coffee products.
I want to answer the following questions: 
- How do my coffee sales change over time for each type?
- Where do I sell the most coffee?
- Who are my top 5 customers?
- Which roast type sells the most?

### Data Source
I will be using the Coffee Bean Sales Raw Dataset. This is found on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/coffee-bean-sales-raw-dataset

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning
In the first steps of the project I load the datasets into Excel and review the data. The coffee dataset consists of 3 sheets called orders, customers, and products.<br>
